            <h1>About</h1>
          <p>
            For those unfamiliar with Odie, allow me to acquiant you. He is a 21-year old artist from San Diego whos 
            music turned me into an absolute stan. Odies music advocates for self-improvement and
            enlightenment of self as he believes this is an important part of
            living. Using music as an outlet for expressing his feelings and
            thoughts – claiming in an interview that “I’m most alive when I’m
            able to express myself.”

            <h1>His impact</h1>
          <p>
            It all started with a random Spotify playlist.
             Like any person, I kept shuffling through songs giving it a degree of my attention until getting bored and skipping to the next one. 
            There were plenty of good ones but when you listen to music as much as I do - you start to get picky. 
            My music taste like everyone elses is subjective and broad, making it hard to find music that amazes me. I was already 30 minutes deep into the playlist, so at this point I was pessimestic about finding anything that spoke to me. 
            Then Northface by Odie came on and I never looked back. Northface starts with a lo-fi aesthetic guitar and bass instruments. 
            Both immediately grabbing my attention which isnt easy. However, the production wasn't the reason I kept listening - ODIE's angelic vocals are what really stand out.
            His voice comes off so effortlessly and passion filled - the kind that leaves you speechless questioning how one person can have all this talent.
            This raw approach is a breath of fresh air in the world of auto-tune and heavy vocal processing. 
            Furthermore, lyrically ODIE's storytelling of his experiences are creative and relatable. 
            Telling through familiar themes such as hope, religion, ambition, goals, finding a soul mate, etc. 
            Such things we've experienced or encountered at least once in our lives. 
            Now, these themes can be found in every music but how ODIE presents them fills you with a different perspective. 
            His lyrics aren't hallowed or valueless the words have an impact and stick to you like white on rice. <br><br>
            So, if any of this sounds appealing I would give him a thorough listen. ODIE's music has impacted me in such ways that I even started to study music just to get a better appreciation for the art. 
            Put simply his music, voice, and songwriting have made a deep impression on me - and after reading this I hope his music does the same for you. 
            Below you will find my recommendations of songs that I believe will resonate. All songs can be found on ODIES EP ANALOUGE.
