          <h1>About</h1>
          <p>
            For those unfamiliar with Odie, he is a 21-year old r&b artist from
            San Deigo. He is undoubtley one of my favorite artist in the game
            right now. Which speaks volumes to someone who's listened to 136,000
            minutes of music last year - according to spotify. Everything about
            Odie is refreshing and exciting. His song writing, production and
            creativity are consistently immersive - giving you a roller coaster
            of emotions with each song. So, I highly reccomend you experience
            this for yourself, and give this king a listen.

          <h1>I LOVE NEW MUSIC</h1>
          <p>
            Like most people, I got tired of listening to the same songs over
            and over again. I can't listen to frank ocean 24/7 - well you can
            but but theres so much good music out there to be discovered. Thus,
            I began my ventrue of finding new music, going to spotify to listen
            to a playlist called Mellow bars. 30 minutes into the playlist and
            Northface by Odie blessed my ears. It starts with a lo-fi aesthetic
            guitar and bass instruments that were aggresive but not intrusive.
            The production wasn't the reason I kept listening - ODIE's angelic
            vocals kept me from hitting next. His voice has a raw approach to
            it. A breath of fresh air in the world of auto-tune and heavy vocal
            processing. Furthermore, lyrically ODIE's storytelling of his
            experiences are creative and relatable. Telling through familiar
            themes such as hope, religion, ambition, goals, finding a soul mate,
            etc. Such things we've experienced or encountered at least once in
            our lives. Now, these themes can be found in every music but how
            ODIE presents them fills you with a different perspective. His
            lyrics aren't hallowed or valueless the words have an impact and
            stick to you like white on rice.
